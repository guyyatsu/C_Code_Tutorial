Python is much easier and quicker to use.

It's kind of packaged as a plugin for the COMMAND LINE;
    which is written in C...

As such, it comes pre-installed with the ability to redirect
    to the COMMAND LINE out of the box.

With C,  you first have to compile & generate an executable file;
    with Python as long as it doesn't throw any errors you can
    execute it as soon as you save it.

You also don't have to designate the end of the line with a 
    semicolon; Python COUNTS WHITESPACE.  Meaning a tab is 
    different than a space, so if we indent we must EITHER
    use four spaces to equal a tab OR ONLY use spaces.

Otherwise you'll get an error just because you didn't distinguish
    between the two.

# Now that that's out of the way; let's do the same thing we 
# just did in C.

# Here we go:

print("Hello World!")
